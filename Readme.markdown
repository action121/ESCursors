[ESCursors](http://earthlingsoft.net/code/#escursors) is a Cocoa class with a number of methods returning a wide variety of cursor graphics. 

The cursors in question are arrow cursors with one, two, three or four arrows at the size and rotation of your choice. If desired, one of the axes of the cursor can be curved. 

Try out our [Symmetries](http://earthlingsoft.net/Symmetries/) application to see a number of these cursors in action.
